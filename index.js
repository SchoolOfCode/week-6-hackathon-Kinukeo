Calling all software superheroes! ü¶∏‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
World-renowned superhero Chris Meah has decided that he will take on new hires and train up the next generation of superheroes.
Anyone can apply, so long as their name fits some specific criteria.

Unfortunately this means he has had to take time off as a programmer, in his stead you must complete the following task:
Fill in the function with the following logic:

  - If anything BUT the following characters are found in the name input, throw an error with the message ("Invalid character found"):
    Lowercase letters a-z
    Uppercase letters A-Z
    Hyphens
    Whitespace
  
  - Check if the name input contains any one of the many "Special agents" in the following list:
    "Anna-Marie", "Nadeem", "Ira", "Andy", "Faisal", "Chris", "Becks", "Lizzie", "Victoria"
    If so, return "Special agent".

    - Return "Superhero" for any name beginning with Super such as "Super Sumeya"

    - If a name begins with super AND is present in the "Special agents" list, Special agent takes precedent.

    Any other input should return "Not super enough"

    All matches should be case insensitive

Once you're ready to test your code make sure to:
cd into the directory
npm install
npm run test

Good luck!

export function superStatus(name) {}
